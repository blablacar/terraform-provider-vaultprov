# vaultprov_random_secret (Resource)

A cryptographic randomly generated secret stored as bytes in a Vault secret. Secret can be either a random bytes (`random_secret`) array or a Curve25519 keypair (`curve25519_keypair`). The resulting Vault secret will have a custom metadata `secret_type` with the type of the secret and a custom metadata `secret_length` with the same value as the `length` attribute.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "vaultprov_random_secret" "example_bytes" {
  path   = "/secret/foo/bar"
  type   = "random_secret"
  length = 32
  metadata = {
    owner    = "my_team"
    some-key = "some-value"
  }
}

resource "vaultprov_random_secret" "example_keypair" {
  path = "/secret/bar/foo"
  type = "curve25519_keypair"
  metadata = {
    owner    = "my_team"
    some-key = "some-value"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `path` (String) Full name of the Vault secret. For a nested secret the name is the nested path excluding the mount and data prefix. For example, for a secret at `keys/data/foo/bar/baz` the name is `foo/bar/baz`. Serves as the secret id.

### Optional

- `force_destroy` (Boolean) If set to `true`, removing the resource will delete the secret and all versions in Vault. If set to `false` or not defined, removing the resource will fail.
- `length` (Number) The length (in bytes) of the secret. Default is 32 for `random_secret`. For `curve25519_keypair`, this attribute not supported (keypair are always 64 bytes long). This information will be stored as a custom metadata under the key `secret_length`.
- `metadata` (Map of String) A map of key/value strings that will be stored along the secret as custom metadata
- `type` (String) Type of secret to create. Possible values are `random_secret`, `curve25519_keypair`.
