# vaultsecret_random (Resource)

A cryptographic randomly generated secret stored as bytes in a Vault secret. The resulting Vault secret will have a custom metadata `secret_type` with the value `random_secret` and a custom metadata `secret_length` with the same value as the `length` attribute.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "vaultsecret_random" "example" {
    path     = "/secrets/foo/bar"
    length   = 32
    metadata = {
        owner    = "my_team"
        some-key = "some-value"
    }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `path` (String) Full name of the Vault secret. For a nested secret the name is the nested path excluding the mount and data prefix. For example, for a secret at `keys/data/foo/bar/baz` the name is `foo/bar/baz`. Serves as the secret id.

### Optional

- `length` (Number) The length (in bytes) of the secret. Default is 32. This information will be stored as a custom metadata under the key `secret_length`
- `metadata` (Map of String) A map of key/value strings that will be stored along the secret as custom metadata
