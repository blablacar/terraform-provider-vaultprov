# vaultprov_keypair_secret (Resource)

A cryptographic keypair stored as two Vault secrets (one for the private key and one for the public one). Only support Curve25519 keypair for now. The resulting Vault secrets will have a custom metadata `secret_type` with the type of the secret (`keypair_curve25519`) and a custom metadata `secret_length` with the length of the keypair.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "vaultprov_keypair_secret" "example_keypair" {
  path = "/secret/bar/foo"
  type = "curve25519"
  metadata = {
    owner    = "my_team"
    some-key = "some-value"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `base_path` (String) Base path of the keypair secrets in Vault. Two Vault secrets will be created at this path: one for the private key (`private`) and one for the public one (`public`) . For example, for a `base_path` `foo/bar`, the keypair secrets will be `foo/bar/private` and `foo/bar/public`. Serves as the secret id.

### Optional

- `force_destroy` (Boolean) If set to `true`, removing the resource will delete the secret and all versions in Vault. If set to `false` or not defined, removing the resource will fail.
- `metadata` (Map of String) A map of key/value strings that will be stored along the secret as custom metadata
- `type` (String) Type of keypair to create. Only supported value for now is `curve25519`.
